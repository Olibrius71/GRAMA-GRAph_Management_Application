# GRAMA_GRAph_MAnagement_application
Made all by myself with JavaFX, Gradle and SceneBuilder (No-Code Graphic Editor). Given a list of places (cities, restaurants and attractions) and links between them, gives access to several functionnalities: show all the places, give the neighbors of a place, compare 2 chosen cities (which is neighbor with the most restaurants, …) and show a view of the graph

While coding this project, I was not used to git at that time, so I used a discord server to keep the traces of all the files and steps, I listed all I sent in discord (with the matching sending date) on my drive as a proof that I'm the one who coded the app, go to the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tKl_6ZCVHEhrRUOgmgeeIlDCPMjxqTXc?usp=sharing
